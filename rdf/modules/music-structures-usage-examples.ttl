    bsc:hasBreathingPattern "Moderate rotation (10-20 seconds per full revolution)" ;
    bsc:hasTrackMapping """6 speakers arranged in hexagon around listener (positions 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°). Single audio source rotates clockwise through all positions. Each row shift moves sound to next speaker. Row position corresponds to speaker index. Creates smooth circular motion around the listener's head.""" ;
    bsc:hasExpectedOutcome """Perfectly smooth circular panning effect. Sound appears to orbit the listener in predictable clockwise motion. The equal-time-at-each-position property ensures balanced spatial distribution. Excellent for immersive installations, planetarium soundtracks, or experimental spatial audio compositions.""" .

    bsc:hasScenario "Round-robin drum pattern variation" ;
    bsc:hasBreathingPattern "Musical tempo (change every 4 or 8 bars)" ;
    bsc:hasTrackMapping """6 drum pattern variations of the same groove. Each row determines which pattern is active. Rotation ensures each variation gets heard in sequence without repetition. Patterns could vary in: hi-hat complexity, kick placement, snare ghost notes, tom fills, ride cymbal, percussion layers.""" ;
    bsc:hasExpectedOutcome """Constantly evolving drum groove that maintains core rhythm while preventing monotony. The cyclical rotation is predictable enough for DJs to mix, yet varied enough to sustain listener interest. Each pattern gets equal airtime. Used in electronic dance music, hip-hop production, and live performance.""" .

Rotation ensures all palettes appear in sequence. Position determines which color set is applied to visual elements. Creates kaleidoscopic color cycling.""" ;
    bsc:hasExpectedOutcome """Mesmerizing color transformations with perfect fairness—each palette gets equal display time. The cyclic nature allows viewers to anticipate and appreciate each color scheme. No palette dominates or gets skipped. Ideal for digital art installations, VJ loops, or screensavers.""" .

Rotates through harmonic spectrum: fundamental, 2nd harmonic, 3rd harmonic, etc. Row position determines amplitude of corresponding partial. Creates slowly evolving spectral texture.""" ;

The rotation reveals the internal structure of the sound, making harmonics audible that would otherwise be masked. Used in spectral music, drone compositions, and acoustic research.""" .
