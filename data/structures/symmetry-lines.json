  "description": "Deterministic symmetric orderings for swapping or rotating parameters; rows are 1-based and return to start.",
  "explanation": {
    "overview": "Symmetry line sequences exploit mathematical symmetries from group theory. These include palindromic (mirror) patterns and cyclic rotations. Each sequence exhibits perfect symmetry: the second half mirrors or rotates the first half.",
    "mechanism": "Two primary symmetry types: (1) Mirror symmetry - sequences reach a midpoint then reverse back to start, creating palindromic patterns. (2) Rotational symmetry - elements shift cyclically through positions. Both create predictable, aesthetically pleasing parameter sweeps.",
    "properties": [
      "Symmetric: Second half mirrors or rotates first half",
      "Smooth sweeps: Elements transition gradually through positions",
      "Dihedral group: Mirror patterns come from dihedral group D_n",
      "Cyclic group: Rotations come from cyclic group C_n",
      "Predictable: Users can anticipate pattern evolution"
    ],
    "applications": "Excellent for parameter crossfades and sweeps. Mirror sweeps create natural rise-and-fall envelopes. Rotations distribute emphasis evenly across tracks. Use for panning automation, filter sweeps, or visual element transitions.",
