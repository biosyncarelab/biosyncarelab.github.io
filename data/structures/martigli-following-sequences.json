  "description": "Orderings aligned to inhale/hold/exhale phases; rows are 1-based and wrap to rounds.",
  "explanation": {
    "overview": "Martigli-following sequences are specifically designed to synchronize with breathing patterns. Named after the Martigli oscillator (a breathing-synchronized waveform), these sequences align parameter changes with respiratory phases.",
    "mechanism": "Each sequence is structured around breath cycle phases: inhale, hold, exhale. The orderings emphasize different elements during each phase, creating natural-feeling modulation that follows physiological rhythms. The phase ratios (e.g., 4-4-2) indicate relative durations.",

      "Cyclical: Returns to starting state after complete breath cycle",
      "Physiologically-informed: Designed for human respiratory synchronization"
    ],
    "applications": "These sequences excel when binding track parameters to Martigli oscillators. As breathing rate changes, parameter orderings adapt in phase, creating coherent audiovisual experiences that feel naturally synchronized with the user's breath.",

      "explanation": "Six-element sequence with 4-4-2 phase emphasis (4 steps inhale, 4 hold, 2 exhale). This ratio creates a relaxed breathing pattern with extended inhale and hold phases. Elements rotate through positions with emphasis matching breath intensity. Ideal for calming, meditative sessions.",
