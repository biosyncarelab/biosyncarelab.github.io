The hunt bell (element 0) migrates through all positions, creating a 'spotlight' effect where each frequency takes turns dominating the mix. Position 0 = -18dB, position 1 = -6dB, position 2 = 0dB (loudest).",
          "outcome": "Gentle timbral breathing with clear mathematical structure. The 6-row cycle is short enough to be perceived as a single phrase, yet varied enough to maintain interest. Perfect for beginners exploring change-ringing principles or creating subtle modulation in minimal music. The simplicity reveals the beauty of adjacent swaps without overwhelming complexity."

Composers can use this pattern as scaffolding for creating complex counterpoint without manual planning. Particularly effective for choral music, vocal ensembles, or multi-instrument chamber pieces. The gradual voice exchanges create natural ebb and flow."

The 120-row Plain Bob Doubles pattern ensures each tone migrates through all dynamic levels multiple times, creating slowly evolving melodic emphasis. The two hunt bells create complex interweaving patterns.",

The 120 permutations create a complete sonic journey with clear beginning, middle, and end. Listeners experience shifting tonal centers and unexpected melodic relationships. Perfect for yoga studios, meditation retreats, sound healing practices, or ambient music composition.

The 120-row cycle provides enough complexity for serious electroacoustic composition while maintaining structural coherence.

          "trackMapping": "6 harmonic partials from overtone series: fundamental (100Hz), 2nd harmonic (200Hz), 3rd (300Hz), 4th (400Hz), 5th (500Hz), 6th (600Hz). Row position determines each partial's amplitude (0 = -∞dB, 5 = 0dB). The 120-row Plain Bob Minor pattern systematically explores all possible amplitude relationships, revealing how harmonic spectra create different timbres. The two hunt bells ensure each harmonic visits all prominence levels multiple times.",
          "outcome": "Profound exploration of harmonic timbre and spectral composition principles. The 120 permutations unveil how the same frequency set creates bell tones, brass colors, string textures, and otherworldly timbres through amplitude modulation alone. Educational for acoustics students and mesmerizing for general audiences. Perfect for spectral music composition, acoustic research demonstrations, or meditation on the physics of sound. The mathematical structure makes complex spectral relationships perceptible."

Row position determines boost/cut amount (0 = -12dB cut, 3 = flat, 5 = +6dB boost). The Plain Bob Minor hunt pattern creates constantly shifting EQ curves, emphasizing different frequency ranges over time. Creates evolving tonal character from dark and warm to bright and aggressive.",
          "outcome": "Masterclass in tonal shaping and mix evolution. The 120 permutations demonstrate how EQ creates emotional impact and genre characteristics. Audio engineers can use this for creating evolving soundscapes in film scores or electronic music. The systematic nature reveals how frequency balance affects perception of space, aggression, warmth, and clarity. Particularly powerful for ambient music where tonal evolution is primary narrative driver."

Row position determines which voice carries the fugal subject vs. countersubject vs. free counterpoint (position 5 = primary subject, position 0 = resting/pedal tone). The Plain Bob Minor structure creates Renaissance-style voice-leading where melodic material migrates systematically through all parts. Each voice gets equal opportunity to shine.",
          "outcome": "Sophisticated contrapuntal composition aid that embodies centuries of voice-leading wisdom. Composers can use this framework to ensure balanced polyphonic writing without manual planning. The 120-row structure provides enough length for substantial musical development. Perfect for choral compositions, chamber music, orchestral writing, or music theory pedagogy. Students can analyze how mathematical structure creates perceived complexity while maintaining theoretical rigor."

Row position determines brightness (0 = off, 5 = maximum). The Plain Bob Minor pattern creates rotating, pulsing mandalas where color and brightness interweave according to change-ringing mathematics. The two hunt bells create complex spiral patterns.",
          "outcome": "Hypnotic kinetic light sculpture that merges mathematics, color theory, and contemplative art. The 120-state cycle never quite repeats in viewers' perception, creating sustained engagement. Ideal for museum installations, healing spaces, corporate lobbies, or sacred architecture. The mathematical underpinning gives the piece intellectual depth while the visual beauty makes it accessible. Viewers often report meditative states and temporal disorientation due to the complex-yet-ordered patterns."
