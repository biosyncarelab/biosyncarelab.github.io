  "description": "Plain hunt cycles for ordering tracks/parameters; rows are 1-based and wrap to rounds.",
  "explanation": {
    "overview": "Change ringing is a mathematical art form originating from English campanology (bell ringing). Each 'row' represents a permutation of elements where adjacent pairs swap positions in an alternating pattern.",
    "mechanism": "Starting from 'rounds' (1,2,3,4,...,N), each transition swaps adjacent pairs. The pattern continues until returning to the starting position, forming a complete cycle. This creates a deterministic, periodic sequence ideal for parameter automation.",
    "properties": [
      "Cyclic: Always returns to starting position (rounds)",
      "Minimal changes: Only adjacent elements swap between rows",
      "Even parity: All permutations are even (determinant +1)",
      "Smooth transitions: No element jumps more than one position at a time"
    ],
    "applications": "In BioSynCare, these sequences can modulate track parameters (frequency, gain, panning) creating smooth, cyclical variations. The predictable pattern provides structure while maintaining variety.",

      "label": "Plain Hunt on 6",
      "explanation": "Six-element plain hunt pattern. Starting from rounds (1,2,3,4,5,6), adjacent pairs swap alternately through 12 changes before returning. With 6 bells, you can modulate up to 6 simultaneous track parameters in a coordinated cyclical pattern. Common in traditional bell ringing as 'Plain Bob Minor'.",
      "usageExamples": [
        {
          "scenario": "Hexaphonic frequency sweep with 6 oscillators",
          "breathing": "Not breathing-synchronized (operates independently at own tempo)",
          "trackMapping": "6 sine wave oscillators at harmonic ratios (100Hz, 200Hz, 300Hz, 400Hz, 500Hz, 600Hz). Each row change swaps which frequencies are prominent. Creates a cyclical weaving pattern where harmonic relationships constantly shift. The 12-row cycle ensures each frequency visits multiple positions before returning to original order.",
          "outcome": "Complex harmonic texture that evolves predictably yet remains engaging. The smooth transitions (only adjacent swaps) prevent jarring frequency jumps. Useful for ambient sound design or generative music compositions."

          "scenario": "Six-track stereo panorama orchestration",
          "breathing": "Independent timing, typically 30-60 seconds per full cycle",
          "trackMapping": "6 instrumental tracks positioned across stereo field (far-left to far-right). Plain hunt determines which tracks occupy which spatial positions at each step. As positions exchange, the stereo image 'rings changes' like bells. Could map to: kick, snare, hi-hat, bass, synth, vocals.",
          "outcome": "Constantly evolving spatial mix that maintains balance while preventing static positioning. The cyclical nature ensures all tracks experience all positions. Creates organic movement in stereo field without random chaos."

          "trackMapping": "6 video layers (background gradient, particle system, geometric shapes, text overlays, color filters, foreground elements). Row position determines z-index stacking order. Each change swaps adjacent layers, creating smooth depth transitions. Position 1 = bottom layer, position 6 = top layer.",
          "outcome": "Mesmerizing visual composition where elements weave through depth planes. The 13-step cycle (12 changes + return to rounds) creates a complete narrative arc. Prevents any single element from dominating too long."

          "trackMapping": "Control 6 synth parameters: filter cutoff, resonance, attack, decay, pulse width, detune. Each row assigns parameters to 6 modulation sources (6 LFOs with different waveforms). The hunt pattern ensures each parameter experiences each LFO shape over the full cycle, creating evolving timbral complexity.",
          "outcome": "Richly evolving synthesizer patches that maintain coherence through deterministic modulation routing. The 'minimal changes' property ensures gradual timbral shifts rather than abrupt transformations. Ideal for evolving pad sounds or ambient textures."

Row position determines which speaker is active. The adjacent-swap property ensures smooth spatial transitions.",

As pattern progresses, different voices take the lead, creating a woven contrapuntal texture. Works well with: soprano, alto, tenor, bass.",
          "outcome": "Rich polyphonic texture where leadership constantly shifts between voices. The plain hunt ensures all voices get equal prominence over the 8-change cycle. Creates interesting call-and-response patterns inherent to change-ringing mathematics."

Each row change swaps parameter priorities, creating morphing granular textures. Minimal changes ensure smooth timbral evolution.",
