# Prior Art & Legacy Review

Purpose: capture reusable insights from earlier BSC implementations and related projects while keeping the architecture lean. Document only what informs current decisions; delete stale entries aggressively.

## Review Checklist
- ✅ Record URL and repo link.
- ✅ Summarize architecture in <5 lines (frameworks, build tooling, hosting).
- ✅ List elements worth reusing (UI patterns, audio algorithms, data models).
- ✅ Note pain points or complexity traps we must avoid.
- ✅ Capture licensing/attribution constraints.

## Targets

### biosyncare.github.io
- **Status:** _Pending review_
- **Notes:** Focus on latest Martigli/breathing implementation. Identify minimal subset that can bootstrap current UI without dragging extra dependencies.

### aeterni.github.io
- **Status:** _Pending review_
- **Notes:** Look for audiovisual session sequencing ideas and any RDF hooks.

### audiovisualmedicine.github.io
- **Status:** _Pending review_
- **Notes:** Inspect visual rendering strategies; capture performance considerations.

### harmonicare.github.io
- **Status:** _Pending review_
- **Notes:** Evaluate ontology integrations or change-ringing assets.

Add new incarnations as they appear. Each review entry should end with explicit reuse decisions (e.g., “Adopted Martigli slider SVG, dropped bespoke state manager”).
